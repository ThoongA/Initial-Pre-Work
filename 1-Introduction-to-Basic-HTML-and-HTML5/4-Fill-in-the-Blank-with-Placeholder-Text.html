<!-- This lesson included a short history lesson on placeholder text. The traditional text used is called "Lorem ipsum text by Cicero", since the 16th century. -->
<!-- From my understanding, a placeholder text is not meant for the final version of the projrect, but rather text in place to save the space for future use. -->
<!-- Using a mock of the traditional text, the "Kitty ipsum text" is subsituted to create a second paragrph in the coding. -->

<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
