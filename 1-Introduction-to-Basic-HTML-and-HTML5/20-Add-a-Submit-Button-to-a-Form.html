<!-- This lesson taught how to create a button that the user can click. The button can have different actions depending on the "type" attribute.
The button is created by writing the "button" element with the "type" attribute valuing "submit". There also must be a closing tag since the element "button" is not self closing.
Some text explaining what the button does is helpful as well. -->
