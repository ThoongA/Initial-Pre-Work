<!-- This lesson taught how to put a link within a paragraph. While the paragraph is wrapped by the "p" element/tag, the link/anchor is wrapped by the "a" element/tag.
"Target" is an anchor tag attribute that tells where to open the link specifically. The value "_blank" tells the link to open in a new tab. The "href" attribute will have a value with the intended website address for the link.
Adding text after the "href" and  "target" will cause the text to be like a button to open the link. -->
