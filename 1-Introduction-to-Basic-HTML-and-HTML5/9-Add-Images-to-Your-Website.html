<!-- This lesson taught that the element "img" is used to add images by using the image's url.
The url of the image is anchored using the tag "src". The element "img" is also self closing, no need for a closing tag.
There is also the "alt" attribute that must be added to an image in case there is failure to load, and is usually for screen readers and accessability.  -->
